# Analysis of Critical Sections and Race Condition Solutions

## Critical Sections Identified

1. **File Access Operations**
   - Opening the file for writing (producer)
   - Writing numbers to the file (producer)
   - Opening the file for reading (consumer)
   - Reading numbers from the file (consumer)

2. **Shared Variables**
   - numbers_written
   - numbers_read

## Race Conditions in Initial Implementation

The initial implementation (task1-initial.c) suffers from several potential race conditions:

1. **File Access Conflicts**
   - The producer and consumer can simultaneously access the file
   - This can lead to corrupted file contents or inconsistent reads
   - The file pointer manipulation is not atomic

2. **Counter Variables**
   - numbers_written and numbers_read are modified without synchronization
   - This can lead to missed numbers or duplicate readings

3. **Producer-Consumer Coordination**
   - No mechanism to ensure consumer waits for producer
   - Consumer might try to read before data is available
   - Producer might overflow the file before consumer catches up

## Synchronization Solution

The modified implementation (task1-mutex.c) uses two types of synchronization primitives:

1. **Mutex (pthread_mutex_t)**
   - Purpose: Ensures mutual exclusion for file operations
   - Protects the critical sections where file is accessed
   - Prevents simultaneous file access by producer and consumer

2. **Semaphores (sem_t)**
   - empty: Tracks available slots for production
   - full: Tracks available items for consumption
   - Implements the classic producer-consumer synchronization pattern

### Implementation Details

1. **Mutex Implementation**
   ```c
   pthread_mutex_t file_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
   ```
   - Locks file access during both reading and writing
   - Ensures atomic file operations

2. **Semaphore Implementation**
   ```c
   sem_t empty;    // Counts empty buffer slots
   sem_t full;     // Counts full buffer slots
   ```
   - empty initialized to BATCH_SIZE (100)
   - full initialized to 0
   - Provides synchronization between producer and consumer

### Benefits of the Solution

1. **Data Consistency**
   - File operations are now atomic
   - No possibility of corrupted writes or inconsistent reads

2. **Proper Coordination**
   - Producer waits when buffer is full
   - Consumer waits when no data is available
   - Natural flow control between threads

3. **Resource Management**
   - No possibility of buffer overflow
   - Efficient use of system resources
   - Clean shutdown of threads

## Justification for Using Two Semaphores

The use of two semaphores (empty and full) is justified by the classic producer-consumer problem requirements:

1. **empty Semaphore**
   - Tracks available space for production
   - Prevents producer from overrunning the consumer
   - Initially set to BATCH_SIZE

2. **full Semaphore**
   - Tracks available items for consumption
   - Prevents consumer from reading non-existent data
   - Initially set to 0

This dual-semaphore approach provides:
- Natural flow control
- Deadlock prevention
- Efficient thread synchronization
- Clear separation of concerns

The combination of mutex and semaphores provides a complete solution that addresses all identified race conditions while maintaining efficient thread operation.
